🚀 Precision Calculator & Parametric Grapher
Precision Calculator & Parametric Grapher is a web-based mathematical tool designed to compute complex formulas and visualize them in real-time on a 2D plane. 
Beyond standard function plotting, it specializes in the seamless rendering of Parametric Equations, allowing users to explore intricate geometric patterns.

✨ Key Features
Advanced Calculation Engine: Leverages JavaScript's runtime expression parsing to support a wide array of mathematical functions, including sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, and more.

Parametric Plotting: Use the | delimiter to define $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ independently. It is perfect for visualizing beautiful geometric curves such as Epicycloids and Hypocycloids.

Interactive Canvas: Zoom In/Out: Precision scaling via the mouse wheel.

Panning: Fluid navigation across the coordinate plane using drag-and-drop.

Real-time Rendering: Features an instant feedback loop that updates the graph immediately as the expression is modified. =]

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS) 

Rendering: HTML5 Canvas API 

📖 How to Use
1. Standard Functions: Enter expressions like sin(x) or x^2, then click the = button or the 📈 icon.

2.Parametric Graphs: Enter $x$ and $y$ expressions separated by | (e.g., 8*cos(t) | 8*sin(t)).

3.Interaction: Use the left mouse button to pan the view and the scroll wheel to adjust the zoom level. 

bout This Project
This project was developed to visually explore advanced mathematical concepts—typically encountered in graduate-level mathematics 
(Calculus and Parametric Analysis)—by integrating them with modern web programming. 
. It aims to bridge the gap between abstract equations and tangible visual data. :3
